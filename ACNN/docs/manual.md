## Basic Usage

1. Make a directory, called "local directory".
```bash
mkdir Au3Pd3-MGO
cd Au3Pd3-MGO
```

2. Initiation of a calculation.
  - Gas phase cluster Pt<sub>13</sub>, generating 100 structures.
    ```bash
    pgopt init Pt13 100
    ```
    Recommended additional settings for gas phase accuracy (increasing squares and planar structures):
    ```bash
    pgopt set creation order 3
    pgopt set creation 2d 0.3
    ```
    Note that `order 1` means the added atom will bind to at least one (usually one) existing atom. `order 2` binds to at least two. `order 3` means the first half of atoms are `order 1` and the remaining `order 2`. The default is `order 2`. `2d` gives the ratio of 2D structures.
  - Gas phase cluster Pt<sub>13</sub>B<sub>2</sub>, B atoms can be anywhere.
    ```bash
    pgopt init Pt13B2 100
    ```
    or equivalently
    ```bash
    pgopt init B2Pt13 100
    ```
  - Gas phase cluster Pt<sub>13</sub>B<sub>2</sub>, B atoms must be added finally.
    ```bash
    pgopt init "Pt13|B2" 100
    ```
  - Gas phase cluster Pt<sub>9</sub>, with two CO molecule attached (added finally).
    ```bash
    pgopt init "Pt9|(CO)2" 100
    ```
  - Pt<sub>5</sub> deposited at MgO surface.
    ```bash
    pgopt init Pt5 100 --surface=mgo
    ```
    For custom surface, for example, `--surface=mgox`, files named `mgox.xyz` and `mgox.json` are required at local directory. The surface files can be generated using `pgopt surfgen` from VASP CONTCAR or XYZ files (see the example section).
    Sample `mgox.xyz`:
    ```
    72
    CELL = 12.878     12.878     14.595 (4.2927)
      Mg       2.045958       8.705236      10.669160
      Mg       4.416078       6.334879      10.667900
       O       2.046976       6.337625      10.618636
       O       4.413058       8.705486      10.616889
    ... ...
    ```
    Sample `mgox.json`:
    ```
    {
        "space_group": "-F 4 2 3",
        "space_group_ref": [0.0, 0.0],
        "unit_cell": [4.2927, 4.2927, 4.2927],
        "citation": "",
        "fix": "0-4"
    }
    ```
    where the first five atoms are fixed. `fix` is optional. `fix` value can also be written as `0,1,2,5-7`. No `fix` (here) means fixing all surface element types. `"fix": "-1"` means not fixing any atoms. If `fix` is removed or changed later by `set opts`, the surface atoms will not be fixed or the fixing will be changed accordingly.
  - Pt<sub>5</sub> deposited at MgO surface, but Pt<sub>5</sub> will be read from given structures.
    ```bash
    pgopt init "(Pt5)" 100 --surface=mgo
    pgopt set molecules+ Pt5
    ```
    For custom clusters or molecules, the name `Pt5` will be arbitrary, like `ptcl` or `cytosine`. A file named `Pt5.xyz` is required at local directory. Multiple structures series in a single file is acceptable. Note the comment line format (for surface case, the number of surface atoms must be indicated). Common organic and small molecules, like C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, do not require user provided `xyz` file.
    Sample `Pt5.xyz`:
    ```
    221
    MAG:0:0.0:1 = 0.0 SURF = 216
       Mg       0.000000       0.000000       0.000000
       Mg       2.149873       0.000000       2.149873
       Mg       0.000000       2.149873       2.149873
    ... ...
    ```
  - Pt<sub>5</sub> deposited at MgO surface, read from given structures, with C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> attached.
    ```bash
    pgopt init "(Pt5)|(C2H4)" 100 --surface=mgo
    pgopt set molecules+ Pt5
    ```
    Common organic and small molecules, like C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, do not require user provided `xyz` file. These molecule files are in `$ACNNHOME/library/molecules.zip` file. The provided molecules are

  - Surface/Bulk-only calculation.
    ```bash
    pgopt init H0 1 --surface=bulk --cores=32
    ```
    Where `bulk.xyz` and `bulk.json` are required in local directory. In `hoffman2`, use `--cores` to specify how many cores should be used for each configuration. For other hosts, `--nodes` might be used.
  - Other creation parameters include `~sampling`, `~hydro`, etc.
  - `~sampling` can be `random/all/grid`. `all`: for adsorbates. generate `<given number>` of initial structures for each isomers in the mole file. In total, `<given number> * <number of isomers>` structures will be generated. `random` (default): for adsorbates. In total `<given number>` will be generated. Each time it will select  a random isomer from the given bare cluster isomers. `grid.<m>.<n>`: for PES sampling. Must use xyfix in DFT parameter. No molecules.
  - `~hydro` (boolean, default `false`): if it is true, then hydrogen atoms will be added to the surface. The number of H atoms will be determined based on the number of top layer surface atoms (within 0.5 Angstrom).
  - (deleted) `~mnohydro` (boolean, default `false`): if it is true, then the molecule will not bind to the cluster via H atom. This parameter is now deleted. `~mnohydro` = false is `~nomoleelems` = [] and `~mnohydro` = true is `~nomoleelems` = ['H'].
  - `~rmhydro` (integer, default 3): only valid when `~hydro` is true. This number determines how many H atoms should be removed because cluster occupies some space.
  - `~lowpos` (double, default -999.0): Usually this is negative. It indicates cluster atoms below `max_z + lowpos`  $z$ position will be rejected.
  - `morder` (integer, default 1). Can be 1 or 2. When the added element is not a atom, but a molecule, then `morder` will be used. It means that the 1 or 2 atoms in the added molecule will bind to one existing atoms at once. Note that this has the different meaning from `order`. The number indicates the number of atoms in the molecule, not the cluster.
  - `~nocluselems` (string list, default empty). Only works with `morder = 1` for adding molecules or `order = 1` for surface cases (no 2D). The molecule will not bind to the cluter/surface elements that are in the list. If an element name starts with `-`, for example, `-X`, then the element names after this notation will only be applied when the current adding atom is of element `X`.
  - `~nomoleelems` (string list, default empty). Only works with `morder = 1` for adding molecules. The molecule will not bind to the cluster via the atoms in molecule that are listed. Can use the same notation `-X` as `~nocluselems`.
  - The combination of `~mnohydro` and `morder` can enforce binding patterns. For example, `~mnohydro = false, morder = 2` will gives H-pi binding.
  - `~loworderelems` (string list, default empty). If the `order` is two, then only the order of elements in this list will be change to 1. This will be useful when considering adding H atoms to the shell of cluster. H atoms require first order. For example, 
    ```bash
    pgopt set creation ~loworderelems H,O
    ```

3. Parameter settings for a stage. The calculation is divided into several stages. Later stages may depend on data analysis of previous stages. Each stage may consist of several stage-steps. Different steps have different computational parameters or accuracy. During each stage, the work will be assigned for all structures for the first stage-step, then for all structures for the second stage-step, and so forth. At some time, there may be some workers work for the first step, while some others work for the second.
  - Single step relaxation using `VASP`.
    ```bash
    pgopt set relax
    pgopt set opts+ "encut=280;lwave=T"
    ```
    The default max number of relaxation steps is 500. The default number of relaxation steps for checking is 100. These can be changed using
    ```bash
    pgopt set args max_step 100
    pgopt set args step 20
    ```
    The default number of SCF steps is 100. This can be changed using
    ```bash
    pgopt set opts^ "scf(iter=400)"
    ```
  - Multiple steps relaxation using `VASP`, for example, using smaller `encut` and `prec` at the beginning.
    ```bash
    pgopt set 0 relax
    pgopt set 0 opts+ "encut=280;lwave=T;cell=15"
    pgopt set 1 relax
    pgopt set 1 opts+ "encut=400;lwave=T;cell=15;PREC=Accurate"
    pgopt set 1 sources- create
    pgopt set 1 sources+ inherit,local,max
    ```
    Note that for gas phase, when `VASP` is used the cell size must be set manually here. For surface case, this is not necessary and it will be automatically read from surface file comment line.
  - Setting $k$-points or DFT+U for `VASP`. Note that the element order will be alphabetic.
    ```bash
    pgopt set 0 opts+ "kmethod=MP;kgrid=1:1:1"
    pgopt set 1 opts+ "kmethod=Gamma;kgrid=8:8:2"
    pgopt set 0 opts+ "LDAU=T;LDAUTYPE=2;LDAUL(-1,2);LDAUU(0.0,3.5);LDAUJ(0.0,0.0)"
    ```
    The number after `set` is the step number. If omitted, it will be `0`. No space is allowed for options.
    For bulk relaxation, make sure there is no implicit `fix`.
    ```bash
    pgopt set 0 opts- "fix(O,Ti)"
    pgopt set 0 opts+ "isym=0;isif=3"
    ```
  - Remove previous defined steps.
    ```bash
    pgopt set none
    pgopt set none
    ```
  - Energy and frequency calculation using `VASP`.
    For single point energy, 
    ```bash
    pgopt set 0 energy
    pgopt set 0 opts+ "encut=400;lwave=T;cell=15;PREC=Accurate"
    pgopt set 0 sources^ restart,1.0-filter.1
    ```
    For Vertical Ionization Potential (VIP) calculation, 
    ```bash
    pgopt set 1 energy
    pgopt set 1 args charge 1
    pgopt set 1 opts+ "encut=400;lwave=T;cell=15;PREC=Accurate"
    pgopt set 1 sources^ restart,1.0-filter.1
    ```
    For frequency calculation, default `ibrion` is `5`.
    ```bash
    pgopt set 0 freq
    pgopt set 0 args read_restart true
    pgopt set 0 opts+ "encut=400;lwave=T;cell=15;PREC=Accurate;IBRION=8"
    pgopt set 0 sources^ restart,1.0-filter.1
    ```
  - Calculation using `TURBOMOLE`.
    ```bash
    pgopt set relax-tm
    ```
  - Add additional structures to previous calculation stage.
    ```bash
    pgopt set relax
    pgopt set 0 opts+ "encut=400;lwave=.TRUE.;cell=15;PREC=Accurate"
    pgopt set 0 sources- create
    pgopt set 0 sources+ read,../../square.xyz
    pgopt set parallel secondary 1
    ```
    where `square.xyz` is a series of structures provided at local directory. It will be copied to scratch directory automatically when issuing the master script command. The name after `secondary` is the stage name.
  - Change surfaces during the steps.
    ```bash
    pgopt set 0 relax
    pgopt set 0 surf mgox
    pgopt set 1 relax
    pgopt set 1 surf mgoy
    ```
    Note that the surface atoms at former steps must be all fixed, otherwise when changing the surface the cluster position will be shifted (the $x_{min}, y_{min}, z_{max}$ will be aligned). The top layers of several surfaces must be aligned before being used. In this case, `mgox.xyz`, `mgox.json`, `mgoy.xyz`, and `mgoy.json` must be provided at local directory or already in the program library. The `json` file provides the fixed atoms and cell size information. These information will be automatically updated in the `opts` arguments. The updated `opts` will be printed on the screen. To remove the surface for one step, 
    ```bash
    pgopt set 0 surf none
    ```
    If no surface is set for the step, the surface will be that specified in `pgopt init`. If no surface is set at `pgopt init`, then the program will create gas phase structures instead of surface structures. Therefore, if you want to create initial structures (instead of reading existing files), there must be a surface set at `pgopt init`.
  - Generating structures without doing optimization.
    ```bash
    pgopt set tasks create
    pgopt set relax
    pgopt relax 1
    pgopt para 1
    ```
    The first command is to switch the task from `global` to `create`. The last command is directly running the master script instead of submitting the script. The directory of generated structures will be printed on the screen when finished.

4. Job script generation and submission.
  - Master script generation and submission.
    ```bash
    pgopt relax 1 --time=24:00:00
    pgopt submit relax 1
    ```
    `relax`, `energy` and `freq` are stage task names. They can be used directly as commands. For custom stage task names, `master` should be the command name, and task name can be specified using `--runt=`
    ```bash
    pgopt master 2 --time=24:00:00 --runt=mixed
    pgopt submit mixed 2
    ```
    The number after `master` is stage name. It can also be non-numeric. The default time of master is 24 hours.
  - Worker (torun) script generation and submission (with no dependence, like in `hoffman2`).
    ```bash
    pgopt torun para 0 24 --time=24:00:00 --x
    pgopt submit torun para
    ```
    `--x` indicates job array, which is recommended for `hoffman2` and `cascade`. It should not be used for other hosts.
  - Job dependence (type I): worker jobs should be executed after the master job starts (this is not a requirement). This is not useful and is not implemented for `hoffman2`. Under this case, the depend command should be inserted to modify the worker scripts.
    ```bash
    pgopt torun para 0 24 --time=24:00:00
    pgopt depend torun para --jobid=10001
    pgopt submit torun para
    ```
    The `jobid` number should be looked up from the result of previous issued `pgopt submit` command.
  - Job dependence (type II): master script for later stages (or extending current stage time) should executed after the current master job finishes (this is a requirement, if one wants to submit two master scripts at the same time).
    ```bash
    pgopt relax 1 --time=24:00:00
    pgopt relax 2 --time=24:00:00
    pgopt submit relax 1
    pgopt depend relax 2 --jobid=10002
    pgopt submit relax 2
    ```
    The `jobid` number is looked up from the result of `pgopt submit relax 1` command.
    The following will automatically determine the depended jobid.
    ```bash
    pgopt depend relax 1 --autodep
    pgopt submit relax 1
    pgopt depend torun para 0 10 --autodep
    pgopt submit torun para 0 10
    ```
  - Notes: If several jobs for the same master stage or the same individual worker are running at the same time, it will be problematic. However, after master or worker jobs finish their time and are killed, the same `submit` command can be used again to continue the calculation. Ideally, to continue a calculation, both `master` and `torun` are needed to re-submitted.
  - When master job is running but no workers are running, the master job is consuming time but does nothing.
  - When some workers are running but master is not, the workers are either doing their current task (for a specific assigned atomic structure) or, if they already finished their current task, consuming time but do nothing.
  - Master/workers belonging to different local directories will not influence each other's job.
  - For `TURBOMOLE`, different multiplicities are specified.
    ```bash
    pgopt relax 1 1-9 --time=24:00:00
    pgopt submit relax 1 1-9
    ```
    The number list `1-9` indicates the multiplicity `1,3,5,7,9` will be calculated separately. If no number list is given, it will be `0`, which means the multiplicity will be automatically relaxed, which is only available in periodic softwares like `VASP`.
  - The automatically generated file `CMD-HISTORY` at local directory includes all commands typed. If another similar calculation for a different system should be done in the future, one can `source` the copy of this file in a new directory.
    ```bash
    mkdir Au5Pd1-MGO
    cd Au5Pd1-MGO
    cp ../Au3Pd3-MGO/CMD-HISTORY ./cmd
    vim cmd
    source cmd
    ```
    But be careful when using `jobid` feature because the `jobid` is dynamic. And all `pgopt log/report` command should be removed from the `cmd` file.
  - Directly run master without submitting the job (not recommended).
    ```bash
    pgopt para 1 0 --runt=relax
    ```
    where the first number is stage name, the second number is the multiplicity (can be omitted). `--runt` specify the stage name and can be omitted. This does not provide several features of the `pgopt submit relax`: 
    (1) This will not auto-sync files from scratch to local. But the sync can be done manually by
    ```bash
    pgopt sync
    ```
    (2) This will not auto-check workers that are not responding for more than one hour and kill them. But the checking can be done manually by
    ```bash
    pgopt check --runt=para --maxt=3600 --delete
    ```
    where 3600 is the minimal seconds for no responding, and with `--delete` the jobs of detected workers will be deleted, otherwise it will only print the workers' id on the screen but taking no further action.
    (3) This will not stop all worker jobs when all structures are finished. You may need to kill the worker jobs manually.

5. Result checking and filtering.
  - Show summary information when the jobs are running (or at any time, if you just want to check the status).
    ```bash
    pgopt log
    ```
    The columns are: stage name, multiplicity (0 means multiplicities are not distinguished), total/remaining/converged/failed/max-number-of-steps-reached/duplicated number of structures, current step index (count from zero), total number of step indices, current number of running processes (workers), total number of processes, state (can be init/paused/running/waiting/finished, time passed since the start time of current state, time since receiving last report from any workers.
  - Check detailed information for master and individual workers when the jobs are running (or at any time). Assume the current stage name is `1` and multiplicity is `0` and the current directory is somewhere under local directory.
    ```bash
    cd `pgopt show`
    tail -f -n 100 master/1.0/par_log.txt.0
    ```
    The command `cd pgopt show` switches between local/scratch directories. The `par_log.txt` file is updated every 8 seconds at scratch directory and every 2 minutes at local directory. So it is advantageous to look at it at scratch directory.
  - Filter results when the jobs are finished. Assume the current stage name is `1`.
    ```bash
    pgopt filter 1
    ```
    The full form with omitted options is `pgopt filter 1 0 --runt=relax`. See `pgopt para` for the meaning of options. During the runtime a smaller (stricter) similarity threshold is used. When filtering a bigger value is often used. By this way, the lowest energy isomer for a series similar structures will be retained. Only the result from the last step of that stage will be filtered. The alignment may also be done after the filtering.
  - Final report generation.
    ```bash
    pgopt report
    ```
    Final PDF report and filter structures are in `report` (local) directory. Intermediate files generated by `VASP` or `TURBOMOLE` are in `restarts` (scratch) directory (compressed).
    
6. Notes.

  - For bader charge/single point energy calculation, remember to set `rescue_bad` parameter to false (the default is false now). When running parallel frequency (FD), this parameter will be automatically set to false.
    ```bash
    pgopt set parallel rescue_bad false
    ```
  - If `rescue_bad` is true, when a calculation has a scf-non-convergence, the program will automatically change the geometry slightly and recalculate. This is good only for global optimization. But dangerous for single point energy calculations.
  
  - make super cells for a xyz file (structure series):
    ```bash
    pgopt enlarge abc.xyz --size=3:3:2 --cell=3.0342942:0:-1.5171471:2.6277765:3.2235271698
    ```
  
  - generate a pdf for a xyz file (structure series):
    ```bash
    pgopt draw xx.xyz
    pgopt draw xx.xyz --plot-force --number=6 --force-factor=0.3 --rotmat=0:1:0:0 --ortho
    ```
    `plot-force` will take the forth to sixth column as vibration data and plot the vibration modes.
  
  - select some xyz from a xyz series:
    ```bash
    pgopt select abc.xyz 4,9,12,14,17,44 "--output=selected.xyz"
    ```

## Examples

1. Pt<sub>7</sub> gas phase with VASP.
    ```bash
